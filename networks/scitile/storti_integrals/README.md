This is an eDSL implementation of volume and surface integrals as defined in : [Treat all Integrals as Volume Integraks: A unified, parallel, grid based method for evaluation of volume, surface and path integrals on implicitly defined domains ](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/computingengineering/article-abstract/18/2/021013/371579/Treat-All-Integrals-as-Volume-Integrals-A-Unified?redirectedFrom=fulltext)

The technique is further investigated in 4D, using hypershere area and volume to check for correctness.
