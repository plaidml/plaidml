Building from source
####################
Install Anaconda
==================
Install `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download>`_.  You'll want to use a Python 3 version.
After installing Anaconda, you'll need to restart your shell, to pick up its
environment variable modifications (i.e. the path to the conda tool and shell
integrations).
For Microsoft Windows, you'll also need the Visual C++ compiler (2017+) and the
Windows SDK, following the `Bazel-on-Windows <https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/windows.html>`_ instructions.

Install bazelisk
==================
The `Bazelisk <https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk>`_ tool is a wrapper for `Bazel <http://bazel.build>`_ which provides the ability to
enfore a particular version of Bazel. 
Download the latest version for your platform and place the executable somewhere
in your PATH (e.g. ``/usr/local/bin``). You will also need to mark it as
executable. Example:

.. code-block::
    
    wget https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/releases/download/v0.0.8/bazelisk-darwin-amd64
    mv bazelisk-darwin-amd64 /usr/local/bin/bazelisk
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bazelisk

https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/releases

Configure the build
=====================
Use the `configure` script to configure your build. Note: the `configure` script
requires Python 3.
By default, running the `configure` script will:
* Create and/or update your conda environment
* Configure pre-commit hooks for development purposes
* Configure bazelisk based on your host OS

.. code-block::
    
    ./configure

On Windows, use:

.. code-block::
    
    python configure

Here's an example session:

.. code-block::

    $ ./configure

Build the PlaidML Python wheel
==============================

.. code-block::
    
    bazelisk build //plaidml:wheel

Install the PlaidML Python wheel
==================================

.. code-block::

    pip install -U bazel-bin/plaidml/wheel.pkg/dist/*.whl
    plaidml-setup

PlaidML with Keras
==================
The PlaidML-Keras Python Wheel contains the code needed for
integration with Keras.
You can get the latest release of the PlaidML-Keras Python Wheel by
running:

.. code-block::

    pip install plaidml-keras

You can also build and install the wheel from source.

Set up a build environment
==========================
Follow the setup instructions for :ref:`Build the PlaidML Python wheel`, above.

Build the PlaidML-Keras wheel
===============================

.. code-block::
    
    bazelisk build //plaidml/keras:wheel

Install the PlaidML-Keras Python wheel
======================================

.. code-block::

    pip install -U bazel-bin/plaidml/keras/wheel.pkg/dist/*.whl

Testing PlaidML
===============
Unit tests are executed through bazel:

.. code-block::

    bazelisk test //...
Unit tests for frontends are marked manual and must be executed individually (requires
running ``plaidml-setup`` prior to execution)

.. code-block::
    
    bazelisk run //plaidml/keras:backend_test
