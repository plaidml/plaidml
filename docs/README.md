# Documentation

## Sphinx/Doxygen/RTD Documentation

Our reference manual is generated by Sphinx + Breathe + Doxygen. It will eventually be hosted on ReadTheDocs.

### Installation Dependencies

If you are building documentation using Bazel, you can skip these installation dependencies. Bazel will handle them automatically.

We use [Doxygen](http://doxygen.nl/) to generate XML files for our C++ APIs, which are then fed into [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) to generate HTML files. 

You can [download Doxygen for your OS here](http://www.doxygen.nl/download.html).

Below are the dependencies needed for Sphinx to run properly:

```
pip install breathe
pip install livereload
pip install sphinx-rtd-theme
pip install sphinxcontrib-katex
pip install sphinxcontrib-napoleon
pip install sphinx-tabs
```

### Building Documentation Locally

The file `docs.py` will perform local rebuilds/reloads of the documentation in real time as you make local changes.

Run `docs.py` using Bazel:

```
bazelisk run //docs
```
