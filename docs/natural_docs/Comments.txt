# This is the Natural Docs comments file for this project.  If you change
# anything here, it will apply to THIS PROJECT ONLY.  You can edit the version
# in Natural Docs' Config folder to make the changes apply to all projects,
# but it's recommended that you edit this version instead.


# Ignored Keywords
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If you'd like to prevent keywords from being recognized by Natural Docs,
# you can do it like this:
#
# Ignore Keywords:
#    [keyword]
#    [keyword]
#    ...


# Comment Types
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Each Natural Docs comment has a corresponding type which determine its
# behavior.  You can define your own here or override the settings of the
# existing ones.
#
# Comment Type: [name]
# Alter Comment Type: [name]
#    Creates a new comment type or changes an existing one.
#
# Display Name: [name]
# Plural Display Name: [name]
#    The singular and plural name of the comment type as it should appear in
#    the output.
#
# Simple Identifier: [name]
#    The name of the comment type using only the letters A to Z.  No spaces,
#    numbers, symbols, or Unicode allowed.  Defaults to the comment type name
#    minus any unacceptable characters.  This is used to generate things like
#    CSS class names.
#
# Scope: [normal|start|end|always global]
#    How the comment affects scope.  Defaults to normal.
#    normal        - The comment stays within the current scope.
#    start         - The comment starts a new scope for all the comments
#                    beneath it, like class comments.
#    end           - The comment resets the scope back to global for all the
#                    comments beneath it, like section comments.
#    always global - The comment is defined as a global symbol, but does not
#                    change the scope for any other comments.
#
# Flags: [flag], [flag], ...
#    A combination of settings that apply to the comment type.
#    Code, File, or Documentation
#        Whether it's used to describe a code element, a file, or is a
#        standalone documentation comment.  Defaults to Code.
#    Variable Type
#        Whether it describes a code element that can be used as a variable's
#        type.
#    Class Hierarchy or Database Hierarchy
#        Whether it describes a code element that should be included in the
#        class or database hierarchy.  Requires Scope: Start.
#    Enum
#        Whether it describes an enum.
#
# Keywords:
#    [keyword]
#    [keyword], [plural keyword]
#    ...
#    A list of the comment type's keywords.  Each line after the heading is
#    the keyword and optionally its plural form for list comments.  You can
#    reuse existing keywords to change their definition.  When using
#    "Alter Comment Type", these keywords are added to the existing ones
#    rather than replacing them.
